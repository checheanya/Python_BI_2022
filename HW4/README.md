## Homework 4 (Numpy library)

The program called "numpy_chellenge.py" is written only using Numpy library. The program contains the following parts:

* creation of three different arrays with different ways *under the if __name__ == "__main__":*
* *matrix_multiplication* function that performs simple matrix multiplication
* *multiplication_check* function that checks is the given list of matrices could be multiplied sequentially
* *multiply_matrices* function that multiplies matrices in the given list are returning the resulting matrix
* *compute_2d_distance* function that takes a pair of points in two-dimention space and calculates the distance between these two points
* *compute_multidimensional_distance* takes pair of points in multi-dimentional space and returns the distance between them
* *compute_pair_distances* takes the matrix where rows are samples and columns are parameters and returns the matrix of pairwise distances between samples
