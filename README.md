## Homework 1 (collections)

The program called "nucleic_acids.py" is written without using any side-libraries. It takes and executes commands recursively. You can find list of commands with the description below:

* exit — end of the program execution
* transcribe — takes DNA sequence as input and prints the corresponding RNA secuence
* reverse — takes DNA/RNA sequence as input and prints the reverted sequence
* complement — takes DNA/RNA sequence as input and prints the complemenraty sequence to the given one
* reverse complement — takes DNA/RNA sequence as input and prints the reverted complement sequence
* translate — takes DNA/RNA sequence as input and print the protein sequence of the first reading frame inside the sequence
* first orf (also callable as "first ORF") — takes DNA/RNA sequence as input and prints the first found open reading frame (if there are no stop codons it prints the sequence starting from start codon till the end of the sequence)
