# Homework 2. Iterators and decorators
> Anna Chechenina, april 2023

In this homework we had some tasks on using and creating decorators and iterators based on the corresponding matrerials from the class. 
The main code is available in the .ipynb and .py format. 
There is no requirements need to be installed since the code is written without use of side libraries.
