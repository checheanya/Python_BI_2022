## Homework 5. Pandas and visualization.

This homework contains two parts: writing a functions and working with the dataframes of mapped reads and annotations; and a data visualization.

In the **part 1** you will find two functions *read_gff* Ð¸ *read_bed6* for reading and converting the corresponding formats to the pandass dataframes.
Then I analyzed the mapped rRNA sequenses from the provided data (see folder data, *.bam* file) and find out which rRNAs out of reference annotation were successfuly read as a complete sequence.

In the **part 2** you will find some pieces of visualization: volcano plot on differential expression dataset (see folder data, file *diffexpr_data.tsv.gz*), pie chart on generated data and exploratory data analysis of some covid-related dataset (see folder data, file *owid-covid-data.tsv*).
